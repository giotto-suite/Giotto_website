# findNodeMarkers

Differential expression at every branch point of a cluster tree: at each
internal node, the clusters on the left are compared against the
clusters on the right.

## Usage

``` r
findNodeMarkers(
  gobject,
  spat_unit = NULL,
  feat_type = NULL,
  expression_values = c("normalized", "scaled", "custom"),
  cluster_column,
  tree = NULL,
  splits = NULL,
  cor = c("pearson", "spearman"),
  distance = "ward.D",
  method = c("scran", "gini", "mast"),
  lfc_cut = 0.25,
  fdr_cut = 0.01,
  min_expression = 0.5,
  min_detection = 0.5,
  min_expression_gini = -Inf,
  min_detection_gini = -Inf,
  detection_threshold = 0,
  min_length = 0,
  rank_score = Inf,
  min_feats = 4,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- gobject:

  giotto object

- spat_unit:

  spatial unit

- feat_type:

  feature type

- expression_values:

  feature expression values to use

- cluster_column:

  name of the cell metadata column holding the clusters

- tree:

  an \`hclust\` over the clusters, as returned by
  \[calculateClusterTree()\]. Built from \`gobject\` when not supplied.

- splits:

  the node table for \`tree\`, as returned by \[getDendrogramSplits()\].
  Derived from \`tree\` when not supplied.

- cor, distance:

  correlation score and linkage used to build the tree. Consulted only
  when \`tree\` is not supplied; a tree passed in already has its own,
  recorded in its \`params\` attribute.

- method:

  method used for the comparison at each node. \`"scran"\` and
  \`"gini"\` take the pooled route described below; \`"mast"\` is
  delegated.

- lfc_cut, fdr_cut:

  thresholds counting toward \`n_strong\`

- min_expression:

  gini: minimum per-side mean expression

- min_detection:

  gini: minimum fraction of a side's cells with expression above
  \`detection_threshold\`

- min_expression_gini:

  gini: minimum gini coefficient of expression. \`-Inf\` (default)
  disables it.

- min_detection_gini:

  gini: minimum gini coefficient of detection. \`-Inf\` (default)
  disables it.

- detection_threshold:

  gini: expression value above which a cell counts as expressing a
  feature

- min_length:

  gini: pad the per-side vector to this length before taking the gini
  coefficient. \`0\` (the default) never pads.

- rank_score:

  gini: keep a feature when its side is within this rank for both
  \`expression\` and \`detection\`. \`Inf\` (default) disables it.

- min_feats:

  gini: minimum features to keep per side

- verbose:

  be verbose

- ...:

  passed to the underlying marker method

## Value

a list of two data.tables: \* \`markers\` — one row per (node, feature),
with \`nodeID\`, \`side\` (\`"left"\` or \`"right"\`) and the method's
own statistic columns \* \`nodes\` — one row per node, with \`nodeID\`,
\`node_h\`, the \`left\` and \`right\` cluster membership, and
\`n_strong\`

## Details

Markers at a node are \*\*conditional\*\*: they are what separates two
sibling branches, so a feature that says nothing at the root can be
decisive deeper in the tree. That is the layer a flat one-vs-all marker
list cannot express.

\`nodeID\` is the \`tree\$merge\` row, so results join back to the tree.

## Cost

A node comparison is a two-group test between unions of clusters, so
\`findMarkers(group_1 = , group_2 = )\` would answer it directly — at
one pass over the expression values per node.

Instead, where the statistic allows it, this runs \*\*one\*\* pass keyed
by the original clusters and derives every node from it by arithmetic.
That works whenever the statistic is a function of per-group
accumulators that are additive across groups:

\| method \| accumulators \| pooled \| \| — \| — \| — \| \| \`"scran"\`
(Welch t) \| \`sum\`, \`sumsq\`, \`n\` \| yes \| \| \`"gini"\` \|
\`sum\`, \`nnz\`, \`n\` \| yes \| \| \`"mast"\` \| a per-cell model fit
\| no — one call per node \|

A statistic needing a global ordering along the feature axis — a rank, a
median, Wilcoxon — cannot pool either, and would be delegated the same
way. The choice is made from the method, so nothing is silently
approximated: a delegated method returns the same numbers, more slowly.
