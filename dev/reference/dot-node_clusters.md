# Node clusters

Enumerate the two leaf sets either side of every internal node of a
hierarchical clustering.

## Usage

``` r
.node_clusters(hclus_obj, verbose = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- hclus_obj:

  hclust object

- verbose:

  unused, kept for backward compatibility

## Value

list whose second element holds one entry per internal node, each with
the node height, the leaf labels on each side, and the \`merge\` row the
node corresponds to. Ordered from high to low node height.

## Details

Walks \`hclust\$merge\` directly rather than repeatedly locating a node
by its height in a growing list of dendrograms. The height-matching
approach this replaced was wrong in three ways, all silent: a node was
never removed from the candidate list once split, so with \*\*tied merge
heights\*\* \`which.min()\` re-selected the same node and emitted its
split twice while the true sibling was never split; heights were assumed
to increase with merge order, which \`"centroid"\` and \`"median"\`
linkage violate; and the list index advanced by two per iteration while
the list was compacted in place. Row count was \`k - 1\` either way, so
none of it surfaced as an error.
